    <p>Last updated: 28 September 2024</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>PSP Detector ("the Extension") is a browser extension designed to detect the Payment Service Provider (PSP) used on the current webpage. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or sensitive information. It operates by reading static metadata from the webpage to determine the PSP in use.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>

        <li><strong>Host:</strong> This permission enables the Extension to access specific webpages for the purpose of identifying the PSP.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>All information processed by the Extension is temporary and solely used to identify and display the relevant PSP information, including its logo and a short description. No data is stored or shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>While we strive to protect your data, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. However, we ensure that our Extension operates with the highest standards of security practices.</p>
